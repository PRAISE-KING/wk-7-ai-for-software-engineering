ESSAY
Q1: Explain how Edge AI reduces latency and enhances privacy compared to cloud-based AI. Provide a real-world example (e.g., autonomous drones).
Edge AI refers to running AI models directly on local devices (e.g., smartphones, sensors, drones) rather than sending data to centralized cloud servers. This architecture reduces latency because decisions are made closer to the data source, avoiding round-trip delays to the cloud. It also enhances privacy by minimizing the need to transmit sensitive data over the internet.

Example: In autonomous drones used for search-and-rescue missions, Edge AI allows real-time obstacle detection and path planning without relying on remote servers. This ensures faster reaction times and protects sensitive imagery from being uploaded to the cloud.

Q2: Compare Quantum AI and classical AI in solving optimization problems. What industries could benefit most from Quantum AI?
Classical AI uses traditional computing techniques like gradient descent or brute-force search to optimize solutions. However, these methods struggle with complex, high-dimensional problems.

Quantum AI, on the other hand, leverages quantum mechanics (superposition, entanglement) to explore vast solution spaces simultaneously. Algorithms like Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Grover's Search offer exponential speedups in certain tasks.

Industries that could benefit include:

Logistics: Route optimization for delivery fleets.

Finance: Portfolio optimization and fraud detection.

Pharmaceuticals: Accelerated drug discovery.

Energy: Smart grid resource allocation.

Q3: Discuss the societal impact of Human-AI collaboration in healthcare. How might it transform roles like radiologists or nurses?
Human-AI collaboration in healthcare has the potential to enhance decision-making, reduce errors, and improve patient outcomes. AI can rapidly analyze medical images, monitor patient vitals, and predict complications, supporting (not replacing) healthcare professionals.

Radiologists may shift from manual image reading to AI-assisted diagnostics, focusing more on interpretation and treatment planning. Nurses might use AI-driven alerts and automation to monitor patients more efficiently, allowing more time for direct care.

The societal impact includes increased efficiency, early diagnosis, and personalized care — but it also requires upskilling staff, addressing ethical concerns, and maintaining trust in human oversight.

 2. Case Study Critique: AI in Smart Cities
Topic: AI-IoT for Traffic Management
AI integrated with IoT in traffic systems uses real-time sensor data (e.g., cameras, GPS, speed detectors) to analyze congestion patterns, predict traffic flow, and dynamically adjust traffic lights. Machine learning models optimize routing, reduce idle time, and cut emissions — leading to urban sustainability through improved air quality, reduced fuel use, and shorter commutes.

Challenges:
Data Security & Privacy
AI-IoT systems collect large amounts of location and movement data. Without strong encryption and anonymization, this poses serious privacy risks.

Infrastructure Costs & Standardization
Deploying smart traffic systems city-wide requires significant investment and standardization across different platforms and manufacturers. Poor interoperability can lead to fragmented systems and reduced efficiency.
